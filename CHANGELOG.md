# Changelog

## 13.1.0

* Respect the `layerName` property of the source format, instead of using `mvt:layer`
* `updateMapboxLayer` now also works with raster layers

## 13.0.1

* Clear text width measurement cache when new fonts are loaded

## 13.0.0

### Backwards incompatible changes

* The MVT format parser now assigns the tile's `source-layer`s to the `mvt:layer` property of each feature. Previously the `layer` property was used, which was not ideal because it is frequently used in OpenStreetMap based tiles. This change may require application code changes where OpenLayers feature info (`Map.getFeaturesAtPixel()`, `Map.forEachFeatureAtPixel()`, `Layer.getFeatures()`) or style function customizations are used.

### Other changes

* Improvements to font detection, to ensure that the correct fonts are downloaded

## 12.6.1

## 12.1.0

* New 'updateMapboxSource()' utility function.
* Accept `Promise` as return type for `transformRequest()`
* Do not overwrite existing search param with access token

## 12.0.0

### Backwards incompatible changes

* The `transformRequest` hook is now called for every single `Tiles` request with the final url, instead of just once with the url template.
* Generated OpenLayers Tile and VectorTile sources previously used the template urls obtained by `source.getUrl()` or `source.getUrls()`. Now they use a `tileLoadFunction` configured by ol-mapbox-style instead.
* Generated OpenLayers Vector sources are now always configured with a `loader` by ol-mapbox-style. The `getUrl()` method will return the url without the `transformRequest` transform. When the url is templated (`{bbox-...}`), `getUrl()` will return `undefined`.

### Other changes

* The `transformRequest` hook now also accepts a url string as return value. When a `Request` is returned, it will be fully respected - not just the request's `url`.

## 11.0.3

* More ol versions included in peer dependency version range

## 11.0.2

## 10.5.0

* Add terrarium hillshade example
* Add getStyleForLayer() function for more efficient legend creation without `recordStyleLayer(true)`

## 10.4.0

### Changes that require attention

#### Font handling and loading

ol-mapbox-style no longer defaults to loading Google fonts when a required font is not available. Instead, it respects the new `metadata.ol:webfonts` field in the Mapbox Style document. Example:
```js
{
  "version": 8,
  "metadata": {
    "ol:webfonts": "https://mytileservergl.com/fonts/{font-family}/{fontweight}{-fontstyle}.css"
  }
  // ...
}
```
The supported template placeholders are
* {font-family}: CSS font family converted to lowercase, blanks replaced with `-`, e.g. `noto-sans`
* {Font+Family}: CSS font family in original case, blanks replaced with `+`, e.g. `Noto+Sans`
* {fontweight}: CSS font weight (numeric), e.g. `400`, `700`
* {fontstyle}: CSS font style, e.g. `normal`, `italic`
* {-fontstyle}: CSS font style other than normal, e.g. `-italic` or empty string for normal

In addition to providing fonts along with the style, this can be used to retrieve fonts from a CDN (e.g. `@fontsource`) or Google fonts. If this metadata field is not set to the style, the following default template will be used:

    https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@fontsource/{font-family}/{fontweight}{-fontstyle}.css

To retain the current behavior (i.e. use Google Fonts), the template URL will have to be

    https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family={Font+Family}:{fontweight}{fontstyle}

### Other changes

* Fix a potential tile cache issue
* Fix problem caused by `getUid` function missing in the full build
* Make `updateMapboxStyle()` work with objects that are not a reference to the original one
* Add support for the `tms` tile scheme for `raster` and `vector` layers
* Add support for the `terrarium` encoding for `raster-dem` sources
* Fix an issue where the `icon-offset` layout property modifies the underlying Mapbox Style object
* Set the correct input projection for `geojson` sources when the `projection` option is used

## 10.3.4

* Fix addMapboxLayer - updateMapboxLayer - removeMapboxLayer sequence

## 10.3.3

* Fix `updateMapboxLayer()` and function/filter cache handling

## 10.3.2

* Export `removeMapboxLayer`

## 10.3.1

* Fix initial visibility of `vector` and `geojson` source layers

## 10.3.0

* Add support for `symbol-placement: "line-center"`

## 10.2.0

* Add support for the `"id"` expression

## 10.1.0

* New `removeMapboxLayer()` function
* Substantial fixes to the `addMapboxLayer()` function
* Manage OpenLayers layer visibility based on the visibility of its Mapbox layers

## 10.0.0

### Breaking changes

#### BBOX templates for `geojson` sources

Previously, the `{bbox-epsg-3857}` and `{bbox-epsg-[custom projection srs code]}` template replacement included the projection's SRS identifier, e.g. `1234,4567,4321,7654,EPSG:9876`. Now, the template replacement just includes the bounding box. This means that e.g. WFS source URLs need to be changed in the Mapbox style.

If you previously had a source definition like
```json
{
  "type": "geojson",
  "data": "https://ahocevar.com/geoserver/wfs?service=WFS&version=1.1.0&request=GetFeature&typename=osm:water_areas&outputFormat=application/json&srsname=EPSG:4326&bbox={bbox-epsg-3857}"
}
```

you have to change it to

```json
{
  "type": "geojson",
  "data": "https://ahocevar.com/geoserver/wfs?service=WFS&version=1.1.0&request=GetFeature&typename=osm:water_areas&outputFormat=application/json&srsname=EPSG:4326&bbox={bbox-epsg-3857},EPSG:3857"
}
```
The reason for this breaking change is compatibility with OCG API Features and other services that do not accept the SRS identifier as additional BBOX parameter.

## 9.7.0

## 9.2.0

* New hook for supplying images without project sprite spritesheet

* Simplified 3-argument signature of `applyStyle()`. The longer signatures continue to work, but are deprecated.

## 9.1.0

* `apply()` can now also apply to an `ol/layer/Group`.
* Backgrounds are no longer applied using OpenLayers's `setBackground()`, but with a prerender function for the first layer

## 9.0.0

### Breaking changes

* ol-mapbox-style now requires OpenLayers 7
* `icon-offset` has been fixed. If you previously worked around the x-value moving left instead of right with increasing offset, you have to remove this workaround now.

### Other changes

* Added support for `text-justify`

## 8.2.1

* Updated dependencies
* CI changes

## 8.2.0

* More secure regular expression for property templates; simplified template handling
* Avoid unnecessary TileJSON fetches
* New `SpriteImage` type for the `transformRequest` option

## 8.1.2

* Add require field to package.json's exports to avoid ESLint complaints

## 8.1.1

* Add main field to package.json to avoid ESLint complaints (was meant to go into 8.1.0 already)

## 8.1.0

* Add support for `icon-ignore-placement` and `icon-allow-overlap`
* Add main field to package.json to avoid ESLint complaints

* Use rollup instead of webpack for creating bundles

## 8.0.6

* Remove `webfont-matcher` dependency. Instead, load Google fonts only when they are not available already.
* Normalize Arial font name to make sure it can be detected.
* Use `sans-serif` as fallback font.

## 8.0.5

* Do not advertise the `dist/olms.js` cjs bundle in `package.json`, because its imports from `ol` are not cjs compliant. This should resolve problems with old bundlers that pick the cjs bundle instead of the ejs bundle.

## 8.0.4

* Add `Accept: application/json` header to requests for jsons. This avoids e.g. problems with Esri servers returning HTML instead of JSON
* Reduce build size by stripping more fields from the style spec json.

## 8.0.3

* Fix `applyStyle()` regression that broke the function when no `sourceOrLayer` was provided

## 8.0.2

* Fix display of optional arguments in API docs
* Fix layer stack regression when layers from one source are spread across multiple OpenLayers layers

## 8.0.1

* Display API docs correctly on npmjs.com

## 8.0.0

### Breaking changes

* The package now provides two separate bundles for umd and ejs. `dist/olms.js` is the umd bundle, `dist/index.js` the ejs bundle. No other JavaScript files are provided in the `dist/` folder any more.
* Imports from the `dist/` folder are no longer supported. They need to be replaced with imports from the package, e.g. `import {stylefunction} from "ol-mapbox-style"` instead of `import stylefunction from "ol-mapbox-style/dist/stylefunction"`.
* The `apply()` function has been replaced with an alias of the default export. This means that `apply()` now returns a `Promise<Map>` instead of a `Map`.
* The auto-generated types are now stricter, because they reference OpenLayers types correctly, instead of using `any`.

### Other changes

* `apply()`, `applyStyle()` and `applyBackground()` now take an `options` argument, which can contain a `transformRequest` option. With that function, urls and requests for styles, sprites, tiles and data can be modified. This can be useful e.g. to fix relative urls or to add credentials.
* Another available option is `accessToken`. In combination with the new support for `mapbox://` urls, it has become much easier to use maps and styles from Mapbox.
* Finally, a set of resolutions can be configured in the `options`. This makes it much easier to work with layers or maps in projections other than Web Mercator.
* The `applyStyle()` function has become more powerful and can now create and populate the source of the provided layer.
* [`feature-state`](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/style-spec/expressions/#feature-state) is now supported. The new functions `setFeatureState()` and `getFeatureState()` can be used to set and get the feature state.
* The build size is now at least 80 kB smaller because of pre-processing of the style specification from the `@mapbox/mapbox-gl-style-spec` package. The umd bundle no longer contains the OpenLayers code that has been there by accident for a few releases, which had unnecessarily increased the build size by almost 400 kB.
* The API docs are now generated with typedoc instead of documentation.js

### Breaking changes

#### Module paths

ol-mapbox-style now ships with transpiled modules in the `dist/` folder, and sources in the `src/` folder. Previously, all modules were provided in the root directory.

When upgrading, the import paths need to be checked. For example,
```js
import stylefunction from 'ol-mapbox-style/stylefunction';
```
needs to be changed to
```js
import stylefunction from 'ol-mapbox-style/dist/stylefunction';
```

* Do not cache transparent colors, making hiding features more efficient
* Fix background opacity
* Respect minzoom from TileJSON sources, avoiding underzooming which can lead to loading thousands of tiles

## 4.0.0

### Breaking changes

#### Zoom handling

The way how we handle `zoom`, `minzoom` and `maxzoom` throughout the library has been reworked:

* When ol-mapbox-style creates an `ol/View` instance, it will be configured with the zoom level range that mapbox-gl uses. When updating from previous versions, you will notice that the zoom levels of the OpenLayers view will now match those in the Mapbox Style object. Previously OpenLayers zoom levels were higher by 1.
* When a Mapbox Style object is configured with a `zoom`, the zoom level will now be interpreted like in mapbox-gl, i.e. you will be zoomed in one level deeper than before the update.
* `minzoom` and `maxzoom` on a Mapbox Style layer were previously determined by the tile size of the underlying source. For raster sources with a tile size of 256, this means that `minzoom` and `maxzoom` are zoomed in one level deeper than before the update. For sources with a tile size of 512, nothing changes.
* `minzoom` and `maxzoom` on a Mapbox Style source now influence the `ol/tilegrid/TileGrid` that ol-mapbox-style creates for a source in a different way. The resolutions will always match mapbox-gl default zoom levels.
* `minzoom` and `maxzoom` on Mapbox Style layers no longer  influences whether the `ol/layer/Layer` instance is  set `visible` at a certain resolution. Instead, the layer's `maxResolution` and `minResolution` are set.

### Switch to the ol package

With version 2.x, ol-mapbox-style switched to the [`ol`](https://npmjs.com/package/ol) npm package for the OpenLayers dependency. Users of `dist/olms.js` will not notice this change. Applications that have been using the [`openlayers`](https://npmjs.com/package/openlayers) npm package should be migrated to the `ol` package too.

If switching to `ol` is not yet desired, it is still possible to use ol-mapbox-style with the `openlayers` package, with the help of [`standalonify`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/standalonify). You have to require OpenLayers as `global.ol = require('openlayers');`. To build the bundle, use a command like the following:

``` sh
$ node_modules/.bin/browserify -g [ babelify --plugins [ transform-es2015-modules-commonjs ] ]  -p [ standalonify --name null --deps [ null --ol/style/style ol.style.Style --ol/style/fill ol.style.Fill --ol/style/stroke ol.style.Stroke --ol/style/circle ol.style.Circle --ol/style/icon ol.style.Icon --ol/style/text ol.style.Text ] ] example/index.js > example/bundle.js
```

### `getStyleFunction` moved to separate mapbox-to-ol-style package

For applications that do not need sprites and web fonts for their styles, a separate [`mapbox-to-ol-style`](https://npmjs.com/package/mapbox-to-ol-style) package with focus on small build size and minimal dependencies has been created. ol-mapbox-style depends on that package.

If you have previously been using the `getStyleFunction` function, you now have to import it from `mapbox-to-ol-style`. If you have not used anything else from ol-mapbox-style, you can uninstall it.

### Google fonts no longer need to be included in the html

ol-mapbox-style now automatically loads web fonts from Google. So in most cases, it is no longer necessary to scan the Mapbox Style for fonts and include them manually in the html of the application.
