You can use the full build supplied by\n * Proj4js, or create a custom build to support those projections you need; see\n * the Proj4js website for how to do this. You also need the Proj4js definitions\n * for the required projections. These definitions can be obtained from\n * https://epsg.io/, and are a JS function, so can be loaded in a script\n * tag (as in the examples) or pasted into your application.\n *\n * After all required projection definitions are added to proj4's registry (by\n * using `proj4.defs()`), simply call `register(proj4)` from the `ol/proj/proj4`\n * package. Existing transforms are not changed by this function. See\n * examples/wms-image-custom-proj for an example of this.\n *\n * Additional projection definitions can be registered with `proj4.defs()` any\n * time. Just make sure to call `register(proj4)` again; for example, with user-supplied data where you don't\n * know in advance what projections are needed, you can initially load minimal\n * support and then load whichever are requested.\n *\n * Note that Proj4js does not support projection extents. If you want to add\n * one for creating default tile grids, you can add it after the Projection\n * object has been created with `setExtent`, for example,\n * `get('EPSG:1234').setExtent(extent)`.\n *\n * In addition to Proj4js support, any transform functions can be added with\n * {@link module:ol/proj~addCoordinateTransforms}. To use this, you must first create\n * a {@link module:ol/proj/Projection} object for the new projection and add it with\n * {@link module:ol/proj~addProjection}. You can then add the forward and inverse\n * functions with {@link module:ol/proj~addCoordinateTransforms}. See\n * examples/wms-custom-proj for an example of this.\n *\n * Note that if no transforms are needed and you only need to define the\n * projection, just add a {@link module:ol/proj/Projection} with\n * {@link module:ol/proj~addProjection}.

The pre-defined properties are listed in this documentation as\n * 'Observable Properties', and have their own accessors; for example,\n * {@link module:ol/Map~Map} has a `target` property, accessed with\n * `getTarget()` and changed with `setTarget()`. Not all properties are however\n * settable. There are also general-purpose accessors `get()` and `set()`.

Within\n * the function, `evt.target` would be the view, so `evt.target.getCenter()`\n * would return the new center.\n *\n * You can add your own observable properties with\n * `object.set('prop', 'value')`, and retrieve that with `object.get('prop')`.\n * You can listen for changes on that property value with\n * `object.on('change:prop', listener)`. You can get a list of all\n * properties with {@link module:ol/Object~BaseObject#getProperties}.\n *\n * Note that the observable properties are separate from standard JS properties.\n * You can, for example, give your map object a title with\n * `map.title='New title'` and with `map.set('title', 'Another title')`. The\n * first will be a `hasOwnProperty`; the second will appear in\n * `getProperties()`. Only the second is observable.\n *\n * Properties can be deleted by using the unset method.

y0 = a(base^x1 - base^x0)`\n * => `a = (y1 - y0)/(base^x1 - base^x0)`\n *\n * Desired value: `f(x) = y = a * base^x + b`\n * => `f(x) = y0 + a * (base^x - base^x0)`\n *\n * From the above, we can replace the `a` in `a * (base^x - base^x0)` and do a\n * little algebra:\n * ```\n * a * (base^x - base^x0) = (y1 - y0)/(base^x1 - base^x0) * (base^x - base^x0)\n *                     = (y1 - y0) * (base^x - base^x0) / (base^x1 - base^x0)\n * ```\n *\n * If we let `(base^x -

In other words, `ratio` may be treated as\n * an interpolation factor between the two stops' output values.\n *\n * (Note: a slightly different form for `ratio`,\n * `(base^(x-x0) - 1) / (base^(x1-x0) - 1) `, is equivalent, but requires fewer\n * expensive `Math.pow()` operations.)\n *\n * @private\n*/\nfunction exponentialInterpolation(input, base, lowerValue, upperValue) {\n    const difference = upperValue - lowerValue;\n    const progress = input - lowerValue;\n\n    if (difference === 0) {\n        return 0;\n    } else if (base === 1) {\n        return progress / difference;\n    } else {\n        return (Math.pow(base, progress) - 1) / (Math.pow(base, difference) - 1);\n    }\n}\n\nexport default Interpolate;\n","// @flow\n\nimport assert from 'assert';\n\nimport { checkSubtype, ValueType } from '../types';\n\nimport type { Expression } from '../expression';\nimport type ParsingContext from '../parsing_context';\nimport type EvaluationContext from '../evaluation_context';\nimport type { Type } from '../types';\n\nclass Coalesce implements Expression {\n    type: Type;\n    args: Array<Expression>;\n\n    constructor(type: Type, args: Array<Expression>) {\n        this.type = type;\n        this.args = args;\n    }\n\n    static parse(args: Array<mixed>, context: ParsingContext) {\n        if (args.length < 2) {\n            return context.error(\"Expectected at least one argument.\");\n        }\n        let outputType: Type = (null: any);\n        const expectedType = context.expectedType;\n        if (expectedType && expectedType.kind !== 'value') {\n            outputType = expectedType;\n        }\n        const parsedArgs = [];\n\n        for (const arg of args.slice(1)) {\n            const parsed = context.parse(arg, 1 + parsedArgs.length, outputType, undefined, {omitTypeAnnotations: true});\n            if (!parsed) return null;\n            outputType = outputType || parsed.type;\n            parsedArgs.push(parsed);\n        }\n        assert(outputType);\n\n        // Above, we parse arguments without inferred type annotation so that\n        // they don't produce a runtime error for `null` input, which would\n        // preempt the desired null-coalescing behavior.\n        // Thus, if any of our arguments would have needed an annotation, we\n        // need to wrap the enclosing coalesce expression with it instead.\n        const needsAnnotation = expectedType &&\n            parsedArgs.some(arg => checkSubtype(expectedType, arg.type));\n\n        return needsAnnotation ?\n            new Coalesce(ValueType, parsedArgs) :\n            new Coalesce((outputType: any), parsedArgs);\n    }\n\n    evaluate(ctx: EvaluationContext) {\n        let result = null;\n        for (const arg of this.args) {\n            result = arg.evaluate(ctx);\n            if (result !== null) break;\n        }\n        return result;\n    }\n\n    eachChild(fn: (Expression) => void) {\n        this.args.forEach(fn);\n    }\n\n    possibleOutputs() {\n        return [].concat(...this.args.map((arg) => arg.possibleOutputs()));\n    }\n\n    serialize() {\n        const serialized = [\"coalesce\"];\n        this.eachChild(child => { serialized.push(child.serialize());

Each state has a corresponding getter and setter, e.g.\n * `getCenter` and `setCenter` for the `center` state.\n *\n * An View has a `projection`. The projection determines the\n * coordinate system of the center, and its units determine the units of the\n * resolution (projection units per pixel). The default projection is\n * Spherical Mercator (EPSG:3857).\n *\n * ### The constraints\n *\n * `setCenter`, `setResolution` and `setRotation` can be used to change the\n * states of the view. Any value can be passed to the setters. And the value\n * that is passed to a setter will effectively be the value set in the view,\n * and returned by the corresponding getter.\n *\n * But a View object also has a *resolution constraint*, a\n * *rotation constraint* and a *center constraint*.\n *\n * As said above, no constraints are applied when the setters are used to set\n * new states for the view. Applying constraints is done explicitly through\n * the use of the `constrain*` functions (`constrainResolution` and\n * `constrainRotation` and `constrainCenter`).\n *\n * The main users of the constraints are the interactions and the\n * controls. For example, double-clicking on the map changes the view to\n * the \"next\" resolution. And releasing the fingers after pinch-zooming\n * snaps to the closest resolution (with an animation).\n *\n * The *resolution constraint* snaps to specific resolutions. It is\n * determined by the following options: `resolutions`, `maxResolution`,\n * `maxZoom`, and `zoomFactor`. If `resolutions` is set, the other three\n * options are ignored. See documentation for each option for more\n * information.\n *\n * The *rotation constraint* snaps to specific angles. It is determined\n * by the following options: `enableRotation` and `constrainRotation`.\n * By default the rotation value is snapped to zero when approaching the\n * horizontal.\n *\n * The *center constraint* is determined by the `extent` option. By\n * default the center is not constrained at all.\n *\n  * @api\n */\nclass View extends BaseObject {\n\n  /**\n   * @param {module:ol/View~ViewOptions=} opt_options View options.\n   */\n  constructor(opt_options) {\n    super();\n\n    const options = assign({}, opt_options);\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @type {Array<number>}\n     */\n    this.hints_ = [0, 0];\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @type {Array<Array<module:ol/View~Animation>>}\n     */\n    this.animations_ = [];\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @type {number|undefined}\n     */\n    this.updateAnimationKey_;\n\n    this.updateAnimations_ = this.updateAnimations_.bind(this);\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @const\n     * @type {module:ol/proj/Projection}\n     */\n    this.projection_ = createProjection(options.projection, 'EPSG:3857');\n\n    this.applyOptions_(options);\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Set up the view with the given options.\n   * @param {module:ol/View~ViewOptions} options View options.\n   */\n  applyOptions_(options) {\n\n    /**\n     * @type {Object<string, *>}\n     */\n    const properties = {};\n    properties[ViewProperty.CENTER] = options.center !== undefined ?\n      options.center : null;\n\n    const resolutionConstraintInfo = createResolutionConstraint(options);\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @type {number}\n     */\n    this.maxResolution_ = resolutionConstraintInfo.maxResolution;\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @type {number}\n     */\n    this.minResolution_ = resolutionConstraintInfo.minResolution;\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @type {number}\n     */\n    this.zoomFactor_ = resolutionConstraintInfo.zoomFactor;\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @type {Array<number>|undefined}\n     */\n    this.resolutions_ = options.resolutions;\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @type {number}\n     */\n    this.minZoom_ = resolutionConstraintInfo.minZoom;\n\n    const centerConstraint = createCenterConstraint(options);\n    const resolutionConstraint = resolutionConstraintInfo.constraint;\n    const rotationConstraint = createRotationConstraint(options);\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @type {module:ol/View~Constraints}\n     */\n    this.constraints_ = {\n      center: centerConstraint,\n      resolution: resolutionConstraint,\n      rotation: rotationConstraint\n    };\n\n    if (options.resolution !== undefined) {\n      properties[ViewProperty.RESOLUTION] = options.resolution;\n    } else if (options.zoom !== undefined) {\n      properties[ViewProperty.RESOLUTION] = this.constrainResolution(\n        this.maxResolution_, options.zoom - this.minZoom_);\n\n      if (this.resolutions_) { // in case map zoom is out of min/max zoom range\n        properties[ViewProperty.RESOLUTION] = clamp(\n          Number(this.getResolution() || properties[ViewProperty.RESOLUTION]),\n          this.minResolution_, this.maxResolution_);\n      }\n    }\n    properties[ViewProperty.ROTATION] = options.rotation !== undefined ? options.rotation : 0;\n    this.setProperties(properties);\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @type {module:ol/View~ViewOptions}\n     */\n    this.options_ = options;\n\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Get an updated version of the view options used to construct the view.

The layer will not be\n * rendered outside of this extent.\n * @property {number} [zIndex=0] The z-index for layer rendering.  At rendering time, the layers\n * will be ordered, first by Z-index and then by position.\n * @property {number} [minResolution] The minimum resolution (inclusive) at which this layer will be\n * visible.\n * @property {number} [maxResolution] The maximum resolution (exclusive) below which this layer will\n * be visible.\n * @property {module:ol/render~OrderFunction} [renderOrder] Render order. Function to be used when sorting\n * features before rendering. By default features are drawn in the order that they are created. Use\n * `null` to avoid the sort, but get an undefined draw order.\n * @property {number} [renderBuffer=100] The buffer in pixels around the tile extent used by the\n * renderer when getting features from the vector tile for the rendering or hit-detection.\n * Recommended value: Vector tiles are usually generated with a buffer, so this value should match\n * the largest possible buffer of the used tiles. It should be at least the size of the largest\n * point symbol or line width.\n * @property {module:ol/layer/VectorTileRenderType|string} [renderMode='hybrid'] Render mode for vector tiles:\n *  * `'image'`: Vector tiles are rendered as images.

The standard way to add a layer to a map and have it managed by the map is to\n * use {@link module:ol/Map#addLayer}.\n * @property {boolean} [declutter=false] Declutter images and text. Decluttering is applied to all\n * image and text styles, and the priority is defined by the z-index of the style. Lower z-index\n * means higher priority. When set to `true`, a `renderMode` of `'image'` will be overridden with\n * `'hybrid'`.\n * @property {module:ol/style/Style|Array<module:ol/style/Style>|module:ol/style/Style~StyleFunction} [style] Layer style. See\n * {@link module:ol/style} for default style which will be used if this is not defined.\n * @property {boolean} [updateWhileAnimating=false] When set to `true`, feature batches will be\n * recreated during animations. This means that no vectors will be shown clipped, but the setting\n * will have a performance impact for large amounts of vector data.

See also `updateWhileAnimating`.\n * @property {number} [preload=0] Preload. Load low-resolution tiles up to `preload` levels. `0`\n * means no preloading.\n * @property {module:ol/render~OrderFunction} [renderOrder] Render order.
