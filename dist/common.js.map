If you want to add\n * one for creating default tile grids, you can add it after the Projection\n * object has been created with `setExtent`, for example,\n * `get('EPSG:1234').setExtent(extent)`.\n *\n * In addition to Proj4js support, any transform functions can be added with\n * {@link module:ol/proj~addCoordinateTransforms}. To use this, you must first create\n * a {@link module:ol/proj/Projection} object for the new projection and add it with\n * {@link module:ol/proj~addProjection}.

You can get a list of all\n * properties with {@link module:ol/Object~BaseObject#getProperties}.\n *\n * Note that the observable properties are separate from standard JS properties.\n * You can, for example, give your map object a title with\n * `map.title='New title'` and with `map.set('title', 'Another title')`.

A preflight type check is necessary in\n * order to mimic legacy filters' semantics around expected type mismatches.\n * For example, consider the legacy filter:\n *\n *     [\"any\", [\"all\", [\">\", \"y\", 0], [\">\", \"y\", 0]], [\">\", \"x\", 0]]\n *\n * Naively, we might convert this to the expression:\n *\n *     [\"any\", [\"all\", [\">\", [\"get\", \"y\"], 0], [\">\", [\"get\", \"z\"], 0]], [\">\", [\"get\", \"x\"], 0]]\n *\n * But if we tried to evaluate this against, say `{x: 1, y: null, z: 0}`, the\n * [\">\", [\"get\", \"y\"], 0] would cause an evaluation error, leading to the\n * entire filter returning false. Legacy filter semantics, though, ask for\n * [\">\", \"y\", 0] to simply return `false` when `y` is of the wrong type,\n * allowing the subsequent terms of the outer \"any\" expression to be evaluated\n * (resulting, in this case, in a `true` value, because x > 0).\n *\n * We account for this by inserting a preflight type-checking expression before\n * each \"any\" term, allowing us to avoid evaluating the actual converted filter\n * if any type mismatches would cause it to produce an evalaution error:\n *\n *     [\"any\",\n *       [\"case\",\n *         [\"all\", [\"==\", [\"typeof\", [\"get\", \"y\"]], \"number\"], [\"==\", [\"typeof\", [\"get\", \"z\"], \"number]],\n *         [\"all\", [\">\", [\"get\", \"y\"], 0], [\">\", [\"get\", \"z\"], 0]],\n *         false\n *       ],\n *       [\"case\",\n *         [\"==\", [\"typeof\", [\"get\", \"x\"], \"number\"]],\n *         [\">\", [\"get\", \"x\"], 0],\n *         false\n *       ]\n *     ]\n *\n * An alternative, possibly more direct approach would be to use type checks\n * in the conversion of each comparison operator, so that the converted version\n * of each individual ==, >=, etc. would mimic the legacy filter semantics. The\n * downside of this approach is that it can lead to many more type checks than\n * would otherwise be necessary: outside the context of an \"any\" expression,\n * bailing out due to a runtime type error (expression semantics) and returning\n * false (legacy filter semantics) are equivalent: they cause the filter to\n * produce a `false` result.\n */\nfunction _convertFilter(filter: FilterSpecification, expectedTypes: ExpectedTypes): mixed {\n    if (isExpressionFilter(filter)) { return filter; }\n\n    if (!filter) return true;\n    const op = filter[0];\n    if (filter.length <= 1) return (op !== 'any');\n\n    let converted;\n\n    if (\n        op === '==' ||\n        op === '!=' ||\n        op === '<' ||\n        op === '>' ||\n        op === '<=' ||\n        op === '>='\n    ) {\n        const [, property, value] = (filter: any);\n        converted = convertComparisonOp(property, value, op, expectedTypes);\n    } else if (op === 'any') {\n        const children = (filter: any).slice(1).map(f => {\n            const types = {};\n            const child = _convertFilter(f, types);\n            const typechecks = runtimeTypeChecks(types);\n            return typechecks === true ? child : ['case', typechecks, child, false];\n        });\n        return ['any'].concat(children);\n    } else if (op === 'all') {\n        const children = (filter: any).slice(1).map(f => _convertFilter(f, expectedTypes));\n        return ['all'].concat(children);\n    } else if (op === 'none') {\n        return ['!', _convertFilter(['any'].concat(filter.slice(1)), {})];\n    } else if (op === 'in') {\n        converted = convertInOp((filter[1]: any), filter.slice(2));\n    } else if (op === '!in') {\n        converted = convertInOp((filter[1]: any), filter.slice(2), true);\n    } else if (op === 'has') {\n        converted = convertHasOp((filter[1]: any));\n    } else if (op === '!has') {\n        converted = ['!', convertHasOp((filter[1]: any))];\n    } else {\n        converted = true;\n    }\n\n    return converted;\n}\n\n// Given a set of feature properties and an expected type for each one,\n// construct an boolean expression that tests whether each property has the\n// right type.\n// E.g.: for {name: 'string', population: 'number'}, return\n// [ 'all',\n//   ['==', ['typeof', ['get', 'name'], 'string']],\n//   ['==', ['typeof', ['get', 'population'], 'number]]\n// ]\nfunction runtimeTypeChecks(expectedTypes: ExpectedTypes) {\n    const conditions = [];\n    for (const property in expectedTypes) {\n        const get = property === '$id' ?

Each state has a corresponding getter and setter, e.g.\n * `getCenter` and `setCenter` for the `center` state.\n *\n * An View has a `projection`. The projection determines the\n * coordinate system of the center, and its units determine the units of the\n * resolution (projection units per pixel). The default projection is\n * Spherical Mercator (EPSG:3857).\n *\n * ### The constraints\n *\n * `setCenter`, `setResolution` and `setRotation` can be used to change the\n * states of the view. Any value can be passed to the setters. And the value\n * that is passed to a setter will effectively be the value set in the view,\n * and returned by the corresponding getter.\n *\n * But a View object also has a *resolution constraint*, a\n * *rotation constraint* and a *center constraint*.\n *\n * As said above, no constraints are applied when the setters are used to set\n * new states for the view. Applying constraints is done explicitly through\n * the use of the `constrain*` functions (`constrainResolution` and\n * `constrainRotation` and `constrainCenter`).\n *\n * The main users of the constraints are the interactions and the\n * controls. For example, double-clicking on the map changes the view to\n * the \"next\" resolution. And releasing the fingers after pinch-zooming\n * snaps to the closest resolution (with an animation).\n *\n * The *resolution constraint* snaps to specific resolutions. It is\n * determined by the following options: `resolutions`, `maxResolution`,\n * `maxZoom`, and `zoomFactor`. If `resolutions` is set, the other three\n * options are ignored. See documentation for each option for more\n * information.\n *\n * The *rotation constraint* snaps to specific angles. It is determined\n * by the following options: `enableRotation` and `constrainRotation`.\n * By default the rotation value is snapped to zero when approaching the\n * horizontal.\n *\n * The *center constraint* is determined by the `extent` option.
